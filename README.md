# Freezerdoor

Freezerdoor is a digital clone of the defunct [Top Gearâ„¢ Cool Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niCQ8pf1W4M) where they ranked cars based on coolness and placed them in one of four categories: Seriously Uncool, Uncool, Cool, or Subzero.

Built using React, react-konva, react-hook-forms (probably overkill,)Socket.io, PostgreSQL, and node.

Freezerdoor supports ~~bickering with your mates~~ bidirectional control trough Socket.io. Combined with a voice chat, it can be used for remote cool wall sessions. There is no authentication, so anyone with the server url(s) can create chaos.

Images are stored as URLs to save on server costs.

## TODO Someday
- Much Better styling
- Way better UX

## Requirements
- A PostgreSQL instance
- Node

## Installation and Setup
1. Setup your own PostgreSQL server. Rename ``freezerdoor-server/config/config-template.json`` to ``freezerdoor-server/config/config.json`` and fill it in.
2. Fill in and rename ``tenv-template`` and ``secrets-template.js`` to ``.env`` and ``secrets.js``.
3. Run the server from the ``freezerdoor-server`` folder using ``node server.js``.
4. Run the front-end from the ``freezerdoor`` folder using ``npm start``. Create a production build using ``npm run build``.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
